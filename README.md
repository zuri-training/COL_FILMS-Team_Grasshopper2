# COL_Films

A project aimed at creating a platform which operates like a movie streaming platform for college students.

This was created by a group of designers and developers, collaboratively working as a team to acheive a goal.

This project uses localstorage to store registed users data for login verification, this was used due to the lack of backend developer in our team

The actual build of this project can be accessed from the frontend directory
